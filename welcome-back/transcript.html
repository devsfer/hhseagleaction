Hope everybody had a great break and we are so excited to be back at school. On this episode, we are going to be speaking with Miss Huntsville, Madison Idelle and interviewing Miss Williams, who is our choir director, and she's going to give us a little bit of information about the choir concert they had before break. This was actually supposed to be our Christmas episode, but we had some technical difficulties, so we didn't exactly get it out. But we're excited to give you this episode now. So without further ado, enjoy.<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;0:56&nbsp;<br>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the HHS Eagle Action Podcast, today's a special episode because it's a Christmas special. And we're going to talk a lot about last week and Colors Day.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;1:06&nbsp;<br>Today we have a special guest, our choir director and she also assists with the band. Miss Williams.<br><br>Miss Williams&nbsp;1:14&nbsp;<br>Hello.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;1:15&nbsp;<br>Good to have you. <br><br>Miss Williams&nbsp;1:17&nbsp;<br>Thank you.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;1:17&nbsp;<br>Alright, so what are some things you've done to prepare for your upcoming concert?<br><br>Miss Williams&nbsp;1:24&nbsp;<br>Um, lots and lots of sectional rehearsals.&nbsp;And just rehearsing bell to bell and lots of coffee and a little bit of yelling here and there, but mostly smiling. Unless they irritate me. But now just rehearsing really, really hard. Just never stop. Never Ends. <br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;1:50&nbsp;<br>Yeah, that sounds cool.<br><br>All right. What is your favorite thing about teaching a music class or being a choir director?<br><br>Miss Williams&nbsp;2:02&nbsp;<br>Probably, when they put a piece together, and it sounds really well, and they're proud of themselves. That's a nice feeling.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;2:13&nbsp;<br>I'd say relationships with the students and getting to see them grow up throughout the years. And you know, my seniors this year, I've had them for six years straight. So yeah, that's a long time to be somebody who's teachers, so you really get to know a lot about them. And that's really nice. And I really kind of enjoy being my own boss. In a sense. It's hard being the only person, you know, in charge of it. But basically, I can do what I want. So that's nice. <br><br>Sounds nice. Yeah. How do you push your students to improve and grow their abilities? <br><br>Miss Williams&nbsp;2:55&nbsp;<br>Hmm.<br><br>I scare them...Does that count?<br><br>Now, uh, we do singing tests. We, you know, go to contest and, you know, that's something that you don't want to go to contest and sound terrible. So, you know, you, obviously you want to get a good rating. So, and then, you know, all region, all region really forces you to be a good musician. Have you ever tried out for all region? <br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;3:28&nbsp;<br>No, but I'm trying out this year.<br><br>Miss Williams&nbsp;3:30&nbsp;<br>Oh, that's good. Well, if you try out and you make it, obviously, I mean, the music's really hard. So always the people who are doing all region, they're going to be the best musicians in the group. So and that's something that, you know, everybody, you know, nobody wants to suck. Nobody. So, I mean, you know, if they have all these different opportunities, they can just grow and succeed and have a lot of opportunities. So, yeah, a lot of its intrinsic motivation. <br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;4:04&nbsp;<br>You guys are so good. These questions are like I need to know, you know. Do you have a message or want to plug something?<br><br>Miss Williams&nbsp;4:12&nbsp;<br>Yeah, come to our concert. December 9th. Huntsville, high school cafetorium 7pm. And then also, this is way far in advance, but May 5th is our spring concert. And that is going to be a big one because not only are we inviting past alumni back to sing with us, the senior song of the concert, but the high schoolers will be performing a piece that is specifically written to fit the the needs of their voices. <br><br>So it's never been performed. It's being written specifically for us. And they will be doing the world premiere, if you will. It's gonna be super fun.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;4:55&nbsp;<br>Well, you guys heard her, go support the choir.<br><br>That's it, folks.<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;5:04&nbsp;<br>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome back to the HHS Eagle action podcast. We're super excited to do this episode because we haven't been able to come out with one in a while but we're going to get into routine again and start coming out with normal releases. Like we were before Christmas break. We have a few exciting interviews two of them with the the basketball captains, and even one with Miss Watkins, our counselor about test dates, which are coming up really fast and some of the juniors and seniors really need to pay attention to that stuff. So enjoy the episode.<br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;5:37&nbsp;<br>Okay, So for this week's senior spotlights we are going to be talking to the basketball team captains. And first I'm talking to Addison Ruth, and she is our senior captain on the girls team. <br><br>Addy, how do you feel like your senior season has gone so far?<br><br>Addison Ruth&nbsp;5:52&nbsp;<br>It is really good. We have faced a lot of challenges. But we have a very close bond this year compared to last year.<br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;6:00&nbsp;<br>More games going well, yes. Better? <br><br>Addison Ruth&nbsp;6:04&nbsp;<br>Yes. We've been winning a lot more games. And we feel better after we were not like I not arguing and stuff where we win together and lose together.<br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;6:15&nbsp;<br>As a team captain, how do you feel you have to show leadership on the team on the court?<br><br>Addison Ruth&nbsp;6:21&nbsp;<br>It's I have to keep everyone in line. So if they're like goofing off to be like, we need to like focus and get together so we can be good this year.<br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;6:32&nbsp;<br>So you said that the team had faced some challenges, but came through stronger. So what was one of the biggest challenge is you felt we faced this year? <br><br>Addison Ruth&nbsp;6:40&nbsp;<br>Um, definitely COVID We've had one of our starters be out for almost four weeks. So that's been a big change. People's had to step up and take that position.<br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;6:51&nbsp;<br>What are you most looking forward to after high school? <br><br>Addison Ruth&nbsp;6:54&nbsp;<br>I'm starting my life, getting out of the high school phase, and being able to depend on myself and not others. <br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;7:02&nbsp;<br>Where do you think about going to college?<br><br>Addison Ruth&nbsp;7:04&nbsp;<br>North Ark for two years. And then transfer to the University of Arkansas.<br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;7:07&nbsp;<br>Nice, so you've got it all figured out. <br><br>Addison Ruth&nbsp;7:08&nbsp;<br>Yep!<br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;7:10&nbsp;<br>For our second senior spotlight interview, we're going to be talking to Hayden Dotson, who is a captain on the boys basketball team.<br><br>So Hayden, which game has been your favorite you've played this season.<br><br>Hayden Dotson&nbsp;7:21&nbsp;<br>The Siloam game.<br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;7:23&nbsp;<br> What about it made it your favorite? <br><br>Hayden Dotson&nbsp;7:25&nbsp;<br>The crowd was really loud. And we played a really good game. And it was really exciting. Be out there playing and the crowd going crazy. Made a lot of fun<br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;7:39&nbsp;<br>So what kind of special stuff has the team done to prepare for the season?<br><br>Hayden Dotson&nbsp;7:44&nbsp;<br>Really nothing too special, just going over the game plan before the game and getting ready for it and getting serious before the game. And that's about it. <br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;7:56&nbsp;<br>Okay, so as a team captain, how do you feel like you show leadership on your team.<br><br>Hayden Dotson&nbsp;8:01&nbsp;<br>I try to be good with all the guys and get good chemistry going on. And I think that we've done a good job of it this year. <br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;8:10&nbsp;<br>It definitely shows that you guys are really close when you play. What is your favorite part personally of being an Eagle?<br><br>Hayden Dotson&nbsp;8:17&nbsp;<br>Hanging out with the guys, being good with them, being close with them, being able to joke around with and just set team chemistry.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;8:30&nbsp;<br>Today we have a special guest, the counselor, Miss Watkins.<br><br>The first question I have for you is how do you prepare for the ACT?<br><br>Mrs. Watkins&nbsp;8:41&nbsp;<br>Okay, so as a high school student, you can start taking, you can start taking the ACT when you're 13 years old. So that's about seventh grade. And you can take it as many times as you want to. The ACT costs $60 to take every time that you take it. However, you may be eligible for an ACT waiver, which would waive the cost of the ACT for you. So a lot of students are eligible for that ACT waiver, they just have to check with the counselor either me or Miss Parker and find out if they receive that eligibility to get a waiver. Once you want to prepare for the ACT they have you can Google some ways online to do that. But the school is fortunate enough to have a program called "On To College". And through that program, it will prepare you for the ACT and it's OnToCollege.com every single student in this building has access to that program. So they go to OnToCollege.com and their login is their school email address. And the password is "ontocollege" all lowercase. So every student in this building in the high school (9-12) has access to that program, and it will help prepare them for the ACT.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;10:04&nbsp;<br>Thank you. Thank you for time. My next question is, where can you find scholarships?<br><br>Mrs. Watkins&nbsp;10:11&nbsp;<br>Where can you find scholarships? That's a great question for seniors. And that's what they're looking for is that money to college. So, we have sent an email to all the seniors that has a list of all the local scholarships that are available to them, and they can click on that, and go in there and see all those things. We also have created a Google Classroom. And we sent all the seniors an invite to that, and sent them the code so that they can get in and look at those scholarships. Another good way to find scholarships is just to get on Google and do some searches. And there are some strange scholarships out there. Like, for instance, there's the scholarships for redheaded people. Yeah, really. So there's some obscure scholarships that that you might have some sort of little quirk for that you could get that scholarship. <br><br>So just doing a Google search, a lot of times they'll help and then the schools, the various colleges that you want to go to, for instance, Arkansas Tech University, or University of Arkansas, University of Central Arkansas, they all have their own Foundation Scholarships that people can apply for. And so if anyone wants to look for a specific scholarship needs help applying for scholarship or finding scholarships, they can always come to the counselor's office to see either me or Mrs. Parker.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;11:31&nbsp;<br>And my last question for you is, when is the next ACT?<br><br>Mrs. Watkins&nbsp;11:35&nbsp;<br>The next ACT is going to be in April. Well, there's one February 12. But it's too late to register for that one unless you want to pay a pretty big late fee. So you can register for the April 2nd ACT, which the deadline for that is February 25th. And the way that you do that is go to ACT.org. and set up an account if you don't already have one and pay your fee for come by and see if you can get a waiver from us. And we can help students set that up as well. So that's April 2nd, and then one after that is June 11th. And the deadline for that one is May 6th.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;12:19&nbsp;<br>Well, thank you Miss Watkins for informing us over the ACT. We hope to have you on another day. That is all folks<br><br>Mrs. Watkins&nbsp;12:27&nbsp;<br>Anytime Daniel! Thank you.<br><br>Elly Harriman&nbsp;12:30&nbsp;<br>So like I said this was actually supposed to be the episode that came out before Christmas break. So it has been a while since we've talked about our sports teams.<br><br>So let's do a quick rerun on those. Before break. We had our first conference game against Pea Ridge. Unfortunately, both the girls and boys team took a hard loss against the Blackhawks over Christmas break both the girls and boys teams took a trip to Neosho, Missouri and competed in a tournament up there the boys came away with the third place. Girls didn't do as hot unfortunately. And after break, we came back and had our second conference game against the Shiloh Saints and came away with two victories. This week. We are playing Berryville at home on Tuesday. And the Farmington Cardinals on Friday at their place.<br><br>Super Bowl Predictions&nbsp;13:23&nbsp;<br>it's Eagle action and we're talking about Super Bowl we got the ranch in the Bengals. Ice Baby so far, the prediction is that the rams are going to win but not by a lot. It's like a 66% chance for the Rams. What are your thoughts Dax? I mean, last time the Bengals had 30% chance of them winning the game. They won the game that was against the top team in the whole NFL the Chiefs. Patrick Mahomes. Well not no more now I do think the rams are definitely the most better all around team but the Bangles do have their clutches with Joey Sheisty in the back I mean into by Chase running out routes doing the greedy so I mean you gotta choose. In ethics you want to choose in logic you want to choose the Rams I mean the guys the best defense in league most likely and really good powerhouse offense. I mean they're they're nitty gritty but you got Joey Sheisty I mean there aint much you can do. Yeah overall the Rams probably have better overall winning but who wants the Rams to win. Everyone wants Joe Cisely on top baby.&nbsp;Absolutely.<br><br>Book Reviews&nbsp;14:55&nbsp;<br>And I am covering Carrie by Stephen King It's like it's a very popular horror novel. But if you don't know like what the plot is, basically the main character Carrie has to deal with not only like the bullies at her school, but also her crazy overly religious mother, Margaret, while also dealing with the fact that she has telekinesis. And it's a very interesting premise. And it comes to like a head at her prom, where these two kids dumped pig's blood on her and she starts murdering everyone. So but very, very popular. I liked the book, especially because it switches perspectives between what is happening in the present with local police reports and like what everyone thought about it, and this one character named Sue, who didn't get like killed during that whole fiasco and what happened to start it but it's, it's not it's definitely something you're gonna like if you're just getting into horror stories, but if you're looking to actually get scared, you're probably going to want to look at like, Stephen King's like later stuff like the Shining or Cujo, because that stuff's actually scary.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;16:17&nbsp;<br>I'm Daniel Sandoval.<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;16:18&nbsp;<br>And I'm Hunter McNeer<br><br>Movie Ratings (Hunter McNeer, Daniel Sandoval)&nbsp;16:19&nbsp;<br>We're going to start our first episode of our movie rating, and it's going to be a new addition to our Eagle Action entertainment news. So today's a first episode is gonna be about Justice League, not the Whedon, but the Zack Snyder cut.<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;16:41&nbsp;<br>So there's a lot of history behind that this movie, because Warner Brothers came to Josh Whedon and asked him direct the Justice League. After Zack Snyder had to leave the Senate and Zack Snyder had a vision for how we wanted this movie to go. And Josh Whedon, which is the directors of Avengers changed everything.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;17:00&nbsp;<br>They wanted it to be more of a Marvel movie.<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;17:03&nbsp;<br>They wanted it to be happy, which is not true to the characters. So once Josh Whedon released his version, Zack Snyder was not happy with it more horrible. It was horrible, and the fans definitely weren't happy.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;17:15&nbsp;<br>Batman Laughs!<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;17:18&nbsp;<br>The fans weren't happy with it. And Zack Snyder released his version of it at the beginning of 2021. Which was amazing. Probably if we had to rate it.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;17:30&nbsp;<br>I'd rate it a 9 out of 10 popcorns.<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;17:34&nbsp;<br>Nine out of 10 popcorns, and we'll tell you why.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;17:37&nbsp;<br>So the reason I like it. It's true to what is supposed to be You know what I mean. I didn't&nbsp;like Whedon's cut it was too playful, babyish.<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;17:49&nbsp;<br>The humor was more Marvel if they were trying to push which is what Warner Brother wanted because they see how successful the Marvel Cinematic Universe was.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;17:59&nbsp;<br>They made Cyborg look horrible and it seemed like it was a crappy character does that the Snyder cut Cyborg has a huge role is cool as a backstory anything it's cut off of the Wheadon cut<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;18:13&nbsp;<br>The big thing was they took that what Wheadon he took out the Flash storyline completely. He added the little that the cyborg a little bit but the Flass had no origin story. And but I think the main problem with it is Superman which was the main the main inspiration for this movie after Batman vs Superman Superman dies saving the Earth and now they face a bigger problem so they bring Superman back with Wheadon doing it completely wrong giving them a screen time of like 20 minutes even though he was the main hero ended up saving the day with Zack Snyder's which was like four hours long. He had a much longer screen time which was what the character deserves since Man of Steel that came out in 2012.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;19:05&nbsp;<br>Darkside<br><br>They gave Steppenwolf it was bad in the Wheadon I didn't like it. It looked disgusting.<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;19:17&nbsp;<br>Also it was rated R in the Zack Snyder. It was rated R. It's way more true to the character as DC is a more darker tone.<br><br>Yeah, shout out to Matt Reese which is directing the new Batman that's coming out March 5. So uh, yeah, it being rated R did bring a lot more to what the characters needed in the DC universe because it's not Marvel. And that's what the fans know. And that's what Zack Snyder knew going into it that it's not a Marvel movie. This is a DC movie, but Warner Brothers was just trying to make money and they ended up ruining ruining the horrible but even after Zack Snyder came out with the movie which was huge success, may, I mean, it went in with every single character.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;20:06&nbsp;<br>Snyder versus a huge Warner Brothers decides to get rid of the guy they don't want. They want to stop it they need them.<br><br>Hunter McNeer&nbsp;20:16&nbsp;<br>We want Zack Snyder back.<br><br>Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;20:18&nbsp;<br>This is a message to Warner Brothers. <br><br>Get them back.<br><br>We're done.<br><br>Outro - Daniel Sandoval&nbsp;20:28&nbsp;<br>Well, that's all folks.
