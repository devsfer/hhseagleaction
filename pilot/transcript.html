                    <p style="font-family: 'Source Code Pro', monospace;margin-bottom: 50px;font-size: 13px;margin-top: 20px;">[Intro Music]<br><br>[Daniel Sandoval]<br>Welcome to Eagle Action, where you get all your Eagle News. Introducing your host, Hunter McNeer and Elly Harriman. <br><br>/loudly/<br>I'm Daniel Sandoval<br><br>[Hunter McNeer]<br>Thank you Daniel for that awesome introduction. Ladies and gentlemen welcome to our first episode of Eagle Action, and over to Elly for our announcements. <br><br>[Elly Harriman]<br>On this week's episode, we're going to be talking about next week's game schedules we're going to get insight from three seniors about their senior years so far and hear from a teacher who's new from our district. <br><br>[Hunter McNeer]<br>So onto Gracie with this week's sports announcements.<br><br>[Gracie]<br>For this week's game schedule we have volleyball playing at Gravette on Monday. Home vs. Gentry on Tuesday. And on Tuesday at Farmington. For football, we have a game against Elkins at their place. The student section theme is still being decided. Come out and support our Eagles.<br><br>[Elly Harriman]<br>Thank you Gracie. Let's move on to our interviews this week. For this week's senior spotlight we chose to interview Kailani Enos whose a section leader for the clarinets. Colton Reynolds whose a football captain and Kenley Mavin whose a varsity volleyball player. We asked each senior four questions, the first one being "What is your favorite class?". First up was Kailani.<br><br>[Kailani Enos]<br>My favorite class would probably be band because I've been in band since I was twelve years old. I've been in it since I was in sixth grade. So going into a new year in high school you're worried about your classes and "I don't know any of these teachers" or "this material might be hard" and having band was like my safe spot. <br>It was where I knew what I was doing, I knew how to do it and I was surrounded by people I've known for a very long time. So it was kinda like an area where I felt comfortable in school<br><br>[Elly Harriman]<br>Next up Colton<br><br>[Colton Reynolds]<br>Econ with Coach Wiggins, it's a fun side of the day. To have him come in after junior high football after you've had junior high kids all morning. <br><br>[Kenley Mavin]<br>Study hall is my favorite class because it gives me the opportunity to do my work so I don't have to do it at home.<br><br>[Elly Harriman]<br>How do you prepare yourself for games events or tests that you have to do?<br><br>[Kailani Enos]<br>I bring home my instrument and practice my music a lot. I go to the Monday and Thursday practices that we have to practice marching fundamentals and practice our drills. You just have to be really dedicated to what you're doing and you have to actually care about what you're doing in order to get better because if you're like "oh I'm going to procrastinate this" or "I'll wait until class to do it", then you're not going to get better.<br><br>[Colton Reynolds]<br>Listen to music, watch film, make sure everything is correct, make sure defense is good. Being back there at safety it's a lot to read and adjust to on a fly. So just make sure I'm correct in everything.<br><br>[Kenley Mavin]<br>Before every volleyball game, I have a ritual of going to Sonic and getting a Vanilla Coke.<br><br>[Elly Harriman[<br>What are your plans after high school<br><br>[Kailani Enos] <br>I would love to attend the University of Arkansas, I've put in several applications to different colleges so ill probably be going to NWACC before I go to the University of Arkansas and I would love to get a degree in chemistry or bio-chem or anywhere in like environmental science or anything lie that. But my current goal is to be a hospital laboratory technician, so I'd probably go to the UCA or Little Rock university for a little bit. But other than that, I don't really know what I'm doing<br><br>[Kenley Mavin]<br>I plan on moving to Utah and going to college and studying microbiology<br><br>[Elly Harriman]<br>Do you have any advice for underclassmen?<br><br>[Kailani Enos]<br>Definitely don't procrastinate in doing your work because all of your homework or your studying is going to catch up to you and you're going to be completely overwhelmed with how many assignments you have yet to do or need to do and cramming for a test last minute is not gonna be very fun. You're not going to retain any of that information, you might get a better score on the test but you're not going to remember any of it.<br><br>[Colton Reynolds]<br>Don't stress about teachers or classes and just like always be on time to class. Don't get in trouble, a lot of people getting in trouble nowadays feels like. And to attend juko in Kansas and play baseball and see what goes on from there, and hopefully make a career out of it.<br><br>[Kenley Mavin]<br>Don't be afraid to get out there and join clubs and participate in out of school activities<br><br>[Colton Reynolds]<br>I deal with my nerves by hanging out with friends before the game, teammates I guess. Listen to music joke around but still trying to pay attention to what we have to do later on. Just, hanging out watch film.<br><br>[Hunter McNeer]<br>Now an interview with the newest English teacher of the Huntsville School District. Mr. Sampson!<br><br>[Daniel Sandoval]<br>How is Huntsville compared to your school district in Michigan?<br><br>[Mr. Sampson]<br>Huge culture shock, the speech patterns are definitely different for one thing. It's hard not knowing anyone, you go from a district where you know every single person and every single kid because it was such a small district to not knowing anyone, so it's a little intimidating, but over time it gets a lot easier<br><br>[Daniel Sandoval]<br>What is your favorite class to teach?<br><br>[Mr. Sampson]<br>It's hard to say what's a favorite because you know I don't wanna come off sounding the wrong way. Everything that's English I can teach English. Like the AP classes. I have AP Lang I like a lot because it's so versatile I get to teach so many different things. Like my drama class is so cool because I get to just focus on plays. So to say one I like one over another, I can’t really say.<br><br>[Daniel Sandoval]<br>How is your transition from your old district to Huntsville’s?<br><br>[Mr. Sampson]<br>Hectic! It’s called the learning curve and like the acronyms that people use that I still don’t know and then the people that they reference. “Go see this person" like I don’t know who that person is. [haha] So that’s been taking a lot to get used to. I’m getting used to the roads, the people, the kids, and the hallways, and just where everything is. But yes, it's actually transitioning pretty nicely, thanks.<br><br>[Daniel Sandoval]<br>How’s to move from Michigan to Northwest Arkansas?<br><br>[Mr. Sampson]<br>So we’ve moved here from Michigan, so to find this was a unique type of story. We just feel blessed to be here, my wife and kids. It’s such a different place but the people here have been incredible, so nice and so accommodating. So we know that we’ve made the right decision, so that makes things such. more comfortable here too. <br><br>[bells ringing]<br><br>[Elly Harriman]<br>Don’t forget next week is homecoming, so every day we’re going to be doing a dress-up theme and an activity during SOAR. Monday’s theme will be pajama day and we’ll be doing an egg toss. Tuesday’s theme is country vs country club and our activity is a horse race. Wednesday is lights out, which is neon day, and we’ll be doing just dance. Thursday is celebrity day and the activity will be dodgeball. And Friday is class color day, so wear your class color and we’ll be doing an obstacle course for the activity. The parade will be on Friday at 1 PM and a pep rally right after on the football. The game that night will be versus Gravette.<br><br>[Outro - Hunter McNeer]<br>Thank you for listening to the first episode of Huntsville High School’s Eagle Action Podcast.
